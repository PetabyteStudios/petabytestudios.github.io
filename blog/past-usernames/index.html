	<div class='post' title='Post #22'><h1>Past Usernames</h1><p>Monday, March 23, 2020</p>For the past 4 or 5 years, I have had many different usernames. So I thought I would write a story or something on how my username evolved over time.
<hr>
So, the very first username I ever used was Brikbusters. It simply related to Minecraft, since I had been playing the game since 2014/2013.<br><br>Later, in early 2016, I switched to SolidCanGaming for a brief amount of time. That username did not last long. Also, around the same time, I registered my Google account. So my email is brikbusters at gmail dot com.<br><br>Later in 2016, I changed my username to Pufflegamerz. I have no idea why I thought of that, and it does not have any relation to Club Penguin. But that name stuck.<br><br>In 2018, I made another name Petabyte Studios. That username was supposed to be multiple people, but it ended up just being me. So, I removed the &quot;studios&quot; part, and now I have Petabyte.<br><br>I still go by Pufflegamerz and Petabyte, but I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch completely. I have simply used the names for too long. So at least I have a cool story behind them.
