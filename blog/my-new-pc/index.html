	<div class='post' title='Post #11'><h1>My New PC</h1><p>March 31 2018</p><p>I just got a new PC about 2 weeks ago, and I love it. It has 8 gigs of ram, and an i5 2400 processor clocking a 3.1ghz. It has a 500gb SATA drive at 7200 rpm.</p>
<hr>
<p>It does everything I need it to do, like running Chrome, Sublime Text, and Visual Studio. It runs Minecraft fine, which is one of my most favorite games. I just got BeamNG.Drive, only to figure out it runs really really slow... and I mean 4fps slow. I was only able to get it to run at maybe 15fps at the lowest settings, with the window screen at it's the smallest state. The computer has no dedicated graphics card other than the CPU's integrated Intel 2000 graphics, which most games, unlike Minecraft, heavily rely on.</p>
<p>Other than than It's a perfect system. My new graphics card will be coming soon. I think I only play light games, like Minecraft, and the exception of BeamNG.Drive. Hopefully, I can run it fullscreen now, with the settings at medium.</p></div><a class='back' href='.'>Back</a>
