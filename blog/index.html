It was more of a hobby project that I made for fun rather than something somebody would seriously use. I worked on it until early 2019, abandoned it, then I started working on the Heb12 android app.
The syntax for Corescript was meant to be very simple, and somewhat similar to MIT's Scratch.

I remember using Windows XP in elementary school, with huge CRT monitors and Kid Pix. I have been using it for long over a decade now, and I have recently decided to switch.

Not only do I remember doing it, but I also have the exact file, untouched since the day I created it. It's not much, but pulling out a file I hadn't seen in years really made me want to share it.

<p>I have just released ScratchFormat to the Chrome Web Store. It should be up in a couple hours. 
I will change up the installation website soon.</p></div><div class='post' title='Post #7'><h1>No More Scratch Extensions</h1><p>November 30, 2017</p><p>Pufflegamerz</p>
<p>Well, this is a bummer. The Scratch Team just announced that they are going to delete all Scratch extension advertisements. 
This means the IsOnline account is gone, the @ScratchMoji account is gone, and all other scratch extensions are gone.
(I had just started working on ScratchFormat at this point)</p></div><div class='post' title='Post #6'><h1>Coding Ideas</h1><p>November 11, 2017</p><p>Do you ever just sit there and stare at your screen thinking, "What am I going to do today?" Me too. As a result, I made a software idea generator. Download it here  (For windows users only)

You can see it here:</p>
<p>https://corescript.neocities.org/editor/#var name=John@break@set name=Jimmy@break@print Hello, (name)!@break@// Hello!@break@input name=What's your name?@break@cls@break@msg Hello!@break@goto 8@break@stop@break@if name=John@break@not name=John@break@play http://www.sample-videos.com/audio/mp3/crowd-cheering.mp3</p>
<p>( Since Wix says it is not a valid url, you will just have to copy + paste it into your url bar )</p>
<p>Also, don't try running it, since Corescript does not like every single command used at once. :)</p></div><div class='post' title='Post #1'><h1>Corescript</h1><p>October 9, 2017</p><p>For the past couple of months, I have been working on Corescript. I have just released 7.1, which you can access here. 
I started Corescript about 7 Months ago. The GUI has changed a lot. This new update mainly includes bug fixes. </p>
<p>P.S. I lost the password to my X10Hosting website, so I will be moving everything to Github.</p></div>
