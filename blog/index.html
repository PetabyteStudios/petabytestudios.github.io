That was my very first website that I created.

</div><div class='post' title='Post #20'><h1>What I Leaned from Working on a Programming Language for 3 Years</h1><p>Thursday, December 26, 2019</p>Corescript is a small &quot;programming language&quot; project I started in the summer of 2017. It was more of a hobby project that I made for fun rather than something somebody would seriously use. I worked on it until early 2019, abandoned it, then I started working on the Heb12 android app.
The syntax for Corescript was meant to be very simple, and somewhat similar to MIT&#x27;s Scratch.

I remember using Windows XP in elementary school, with huge CRT monitors and Kid Pix. I have been using it for long over a decade now, and I have recently decided to switch.

Not only do I remember doing it, but I also have the exact file, untouched since the day I created it. It&#x27;s not much, but pulling out a file I hadn&#x27;t seen in years really made me want to share it.

The thing is, I quit uninstalled the game because of how strange the community is becoming.

This means the IsOnline account is gone, the @ScratchMoji account is gone, and all other scratch extensions are gone.
(I had just started working on ScratchFormat at this point)

I started Corescript about 7 Months ago. The GUI has changed a lot. This new update mainly includes bug fixes. <br><br>P.S. I lost the password to my X10Hosting website, so I will be moving everything to Github.<br><br></div>
