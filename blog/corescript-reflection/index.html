	<div class='post' title='Post #20'><h1>What I Leaned from Working on a Programming Language for 3 Years</h1><p>Thursday, December 26, 2019</p>Corescript is a small &quot;programming language&quot; project I started in the summer of 2017. It was more of a hobby project that I made for fun rather than something somebody would seriously use. I worked on it until early 2019, abandoned it, then I started working on the Heb12 android app.
The syntax for Corescript was meant to be very simple, and somewhat similar to MIT&#x27;s Scratch.
<hr>
This is a simple program:<br><br><code class='long'>var greeting = Good Morning
input name = What&#x27;s your name?<br><br>print (greeting), (name)!
</code><br><br>I thought this was the most simple way to write a program. 
It took some syntax inspiration from BASIC and Microsoft Batch.<br><br>
Also, I had a very simple and easy way to interpret Corescript code. 
The code &quot;print Hello, World&quot; would simply be interpreted with code like this psudocode:<br><br><code class='long'>if line starts with &quot;print&quot;
   remove first 6 characters of line
   return
</code><br><br>I know, it wasn&#x27;t very efficient, but I made it work for a while. I also ended up writing many 
programs in Corescript, such as a text adventure, a calculator, etc. I have somehow not released these yet.<br><br>In January of 2018 I decided to re-write Corescript, again. This time I wanted to make it much 
more complex, with syntax highlighting, custom commands, and learn 
from the mistakes of my previous versions. 
Even now, over a year later, I still find it impressive.<br><br><h1>New Plans For Corescript</h1><br><br>Over the past year, I have been thinking of ideas for a new Corescript. First, I want to completely redesign the parser. It would still be similar to the previous versions, but allow for more complex features, like functions.
I also would like to design it to also parse different languages. For example, a Corescript Spanish program could look like this:<br><br><code class='long'>imprimir Buenos Dias!
*Sorry about my bad Spanish
</code><br><br>This program would simply print &quot;Buenos Dias!&quot;. This could also work many different languages. 
I could also have a program to translate the programs from different languages.<br><br>I&#x27;m not sure when I will start working on this, but at the time I am busy maintaining Heb12 Mobile. <br><br><h2>Why Corescript?</h2>
In 2017 I did a lot of searching to see if &quot;Corescript&quot; was taken. I couldn&#x27;t find anything,
with the exception of a Roblox CoreScript. But as far as I can tell, it just means a &quot;Core&quot; script.
You could point to https://github.com/stephanbruny/corescript and say that I copied that, but that project
started in February 2018, while my Corescript started in April 2017. If anything, they copied me (although I highly doubt it)<br><br></div><a class='back' href='.'>Back</a>
