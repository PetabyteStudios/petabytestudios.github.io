	<div class='post' title='Post #19'><h1>The Struggle of Moving to Linux</h1><p>October 17, 2019</p>I have been using Windows for pretty much all my life. I remember using Windows XP in elementary school, with huge CRT monitors and Kid Pix. I have been using it for long over a decade now, and I have recently decided to switch.
<hr>
For about a month I have been migrating from Windows 10 to Ubuntu MATE. It&#x27;s not an easy process, but it&#x27;s worth it. I love the MATE desktop, it has just the right amount of classic and modern. I still boot up Windows every now and then just to play a game (BeamNG.Drive, mostly), but the majority of my work is now being done in my new OS.<br><br>Even though the switch was definitely a good decision, there are still some things I miss about using Windows. Here are some examples:<br><br><h2>Software Support</h2>
A lot of software, especially games, run solely on Windows. For example, Rufus, a USB drive writing software I use often, only runs on Windows. I was disappointed to find out about this, since it had many features that other alternatives didn&#x27;t. Also, this does not have anything to do with open-source software.<br><br><h2>Fixing Problems</h2>
For some reason, whenever I had an issue with Windows, I could easily search it up on the internet and quickly find a solution. With Linux and the countless distros out there, finding help on small issues seems almost impossible. I still have several small problems that I&#x27;ve never been able to fix.<br><br><h2>Admin/User</h2>
I&#x27;ve heard countless people say, &quot;In Windows, you are a user. In Linux, you are the Admin&quot;. When I switched, I didn&#x27;t feel like an admin no more than I did on Windows. A lot of the files I create in Linux, I have to give myself permission to edit, which completely contradicted what people said. It might just be my file manager, but this is definitely something that annoys me.<br><br>There are many things I wish people told me about Linux before I started using it. I have tried other Linux distros, but Ubuntu MATE is the only one that just felt right. I still hate Windows 10, with it&#x27;s bloated core and how it&#x27;s extremely slow.
