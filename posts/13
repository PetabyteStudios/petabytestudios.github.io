Homemade Computer Case
June 15 2018

So I had an old laptop - and turned into a desktop. But there's a catch: I built it in a cardboard box. Yes, it may sound like the most ridiculous thing you have ever heard, but it was fun to make.

Mounting the motherboard to the cardboard box was the hardest part.

I used an old copper wire instead of screws and tied it into holes in bottom of the cardboard box. Duct tape was one the things I used the most. I used it to hold the CD drive in, the power brick, and a whole lot more.

It looks like a piece of trash, but it works. If you want something amusing to do, try this.
