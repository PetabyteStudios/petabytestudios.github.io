I Hate Notifications
Dec 9 2021
---
I hate them so much, I have completely
eradicated them from my life. Here's how:

- I have zero notifications set up on all of my computers.
- My phone is almost always on slient (except for calls)
- I often don't have a web browser open. When I do, I
  generally 2 or 3 tabs open at most.
- I never keep any messaging apps open or running.
- When I do send a message, I close the tab and read
  responses when I feel like it.

Overall, this has helped my anxiety a ton, and I can
focus a lot better.
