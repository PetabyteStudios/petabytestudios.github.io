Well, this is a bummer. The Scratch Team just announced that they are going to delete all Scratch extension advertisements. 
This means the IsOnline account is gone, the @ScratchMoji account is gone, and all other scratch extensions are gone.
(I had just started working on ScratchFormat at this point)
