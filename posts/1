Corescript
October 9, 2017

For the past couple of months, I have been working on Corescript. I have just released 7.1, which you can access here. 
I started Corescript about 7 Months ago. The GUI has changed a lot. This new update mainly includes bug fixes. 

P.S. I lost the password to my X10Hosting website, so I will be moving everything to Github.
