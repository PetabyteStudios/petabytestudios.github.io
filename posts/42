Why I Don't Monetize my Software Projects
July 2 2022

As an amateur software developer, the question I get asked the most is:
"When is that million dollar app coming out?"

I tend to say I don't know, or I don't have any good app ideas, but I never
give an accurate answer. After all, it's not easy to explain to the average
Joe why a hobby OS or a firmware hack isn't making a ton of money.

This is a post explaining why amateur software developers (especially
open source programmers) don't monetize or make money off their projects.

## I Don't Know How To
At least for me, the biggest reason for me no monetizing my projects is because
*I have no idea how to monetize*. I don't know how to get people to pay money for stuff,
or market a product, or manage an online audience. Heck, I can't even figure
out how to manage a Twitter account.
This is a big reason for why most programmers are better off working for a company
with a dedicated marketing team instead of trying to do everything on their own.

And most importantly, I *hate* marketing and monetizing. If it's just a hobby
project, why do something I hate to try and make little money from it?

## It's a Hobby
People work on hobby projects solely because it's enjoyable. Whether it's a

because it's cool and rewarding to see the final result. Trying to turn it
into a money project can ruin the enjoyment.
